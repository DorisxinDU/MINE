## Installation

To install `cd` to the directory of the repository and run `pip install -e .`

## Usage

The file `example.py` contains a simple usage example where the mutual information between two correlated gaussian variables is estimated. To run the example `cd` to the directory of the repository and run `python example.py`. You should see something like this:
